# ArtML
The biggest project and the biggest failure yet. It was supposed to create ML app that would work in background and connect to frontend. AI part wasn't complete as it couldn't make predictions on user input. Frontend wasn't working, as it didn't have AI to complement it.
Initially i thought that my mistake was aiming too high, but then i got the greatest piece of advice I could ever imagine. 

It's not about trying not to aim for the stars. It's about making conscious decisions at the right time. If something doesn't work, maybe try different way? Or reconsider the idea as a whole? Don't wait, as it may be already too late to change anything and you're stuck with something you hate
