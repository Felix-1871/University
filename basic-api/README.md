# Basic API Project

This project is an attempt to build a basic API with Python and Flask. It provides a CLI for interacting with a json database of quotes about AI.
This was my first contact with Python and Flask, and it didn't go well. Looking back it makes me cringe seeing errors i made, but hey. That's what learning should be about 😁
